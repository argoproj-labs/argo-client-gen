# Client Libraries

This page contains an overview of the client libraries for using the Argo API from various programming languages.

* [Officially-supported client libraries](#officially-supported-client-libraries)
* [Community-maintained client libraries](#community-maintained-client-libraries)

To write applications using the  REST API, you do not need to implement the API calls and request/response types yourself. You can use a client library for the programming language you are using.

 Client libraries often handle common tasks such as authentication for you.
